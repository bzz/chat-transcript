Act as AI coding assistant. Please, write a JavaScript function that can be used as a bookmarklet in Chrome. It should work on https://chat.openai.com/ and 

1. find in the HTML page all the nodes matching XPath `//*[@id="__next"]/div[2]/div[2]/div/main/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div[1]/div` and save them to “messages” array. Report an alert if the size of array is not even.  Handle the case no matching XPath gracefully.

2. Use “model” variable to save the current model’s name: if there is a “model” argument in URL use its value, otherwise it is “gpt-3.5-turbo”.

Then save the results in a JSON format:

```
model=“{model}”,
messages=[
        {“role”: “user”, “content”: <messages[i]>},
        {“role”: “assistant”, “content”: <messages[I+1]>},
    ]
```

Then come up with a creative file name without whitespaces based on the content of the first element of the messages array, and trigger downloading this file.
